<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Common-method variance&nbsp;(CMV) is the spurious &quot;variance that is attributable to the&nbsp;measurement&nbsp;method rather than to the&nbsp;constructs&nbsp;the measures are assumed to represent&quot; (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003).&nbsp;</span></span>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">You can control for this method variance by adding a 'methods factor' to the proposed measurement model. This methods factor will have all variables as indicators and the covariance between this methods factor and all other factors will be fixed to zero.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Because the CMV model requires many parameters to be estimated, there are often convergence issues. Therefore, you can also fix all indicators of the 'methods factor' to be equal. That way, all indicators of the methods factor will have the same loading and less parameters need to be estimated.</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">When the common method model has a better fit, you could look at the extent to which the intercorrelations among the main variables significantly differed from the proposed model (for an example, see Shin et al., 2017). You can find the correlations in the lavaan output in 'Detailed CFA Summary'. (i.e., std.all column at the covariance section).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></div>
